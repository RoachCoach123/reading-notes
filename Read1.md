Markdown application is design to support basic syntax. Also it is useful for beginners who is exploring through out the applications and it is the easiest way to learn coding. It would be difficult, not impossible to start out at a varying degrees without a proper guidance. However, Markdown application gives the user just that, the basic. Once user gets the hang of it then they coud acquired different skills at their own level. I have provided examples below on the simplest codes that anyone could enter. Feel free to provide feedback.
