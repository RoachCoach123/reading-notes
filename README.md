## My Intrepetation of Growth Mindset

*In order to grow, one have to open up to new ideas but also challenges for debate to get greater understanding. When an idea is being reciprocated and recognised, it is better to be shared with others as a team or giving the credit to most deserving and be happy for them. This will free one from self doubt and enable them to carry on*

- Keep trying
- Ask for help
- Keep reminders around of where you started from

>When we're growing, we're more productive. When we're productive, I feel better.
