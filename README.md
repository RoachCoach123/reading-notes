##My Intrepetation of Growth Mindset

*It is when one realized that they are not the center of attention and also center attention. One also has to realized in order to grow, they have to open up to new ideas but also open for debate in order to get clarification. When all said and done, one accomplishment is better to be shared as a team or giving the credit to most deserving and be happy for others. Thus one realized that they are not center of attention but being recognized for their accomplished through others as a indirect contributors or as a team.*

- Keep trying
- Ask for help
- Keep reminders around of where you started from
