My learning journal for Code Fellows!

Hi all! My name is Ezaan, and I am a U.S. Navy Veterans. A little bit about myself, I am originally from Everett, Washington and I joined the service a year after high school under the programs called DEPS(Delayed Entry Program). I was Active Duty for 11 and half years and I was honorably discharged couple months ago. I was stationed on three warships on my first 8 years:

1. The first ship was a guided missile frigate-flight 2, USS Klakring (FFG-42) homeported in Naval Base Mayport, Florida. 
2. The second waship was a guided missile destroyer-flight 2, USS Chafee (DDG-90) Homeported in Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Oahu Hawaii. 
3. Third Ships was a guided missile cruiser-flight 1, USS Chancelorsville, (CG-62) Homeported out of U.S. Naval Base Yokosuka, Japan. 

After my tour of Sea duties, I did my twilight tour on U.S. Naval Reserve Center Knoxville, Tennessee as a Command Career Counselor. Now that I am back, I am excited and looking forward to start this new chapter my life!

## My Intrepetation of Growth Mindset

*In order to grow, one have to open up to new ideas but also accept challenges for debate to get greater understanding. When an idea is being reciprocated and recognised, it is better to be shared with others as a team or giving the credit to most deserving and be happy for them. This will free one from self doubt and enable them to carry on*

- Moving forward, learn from mistake
- Reach out and extend hand to help others
- Remind myself why I chose this path

> When we're growing, we're more productive. When we're productive, I feel better.

<sup>Beside the inspiring quotes mentioned above, I also want to remind myself to work hard and pour everything I have into this program so that I may be able to move back and land a job in Japan. This is a picture of me and my younger brother visiting me back when I was stationed in U.S. Naval Base Yokosuka. Really loved it there and now since I am home here in Seattle, I really need to work really hard to get where I want as a civilian.
