## My Intrepetation of Growth Mindset

*In order to grow, one have to open up to new ideas but also challenges for debate to get greater understanding. When an idea is being reciprocated and recognised, it is better to be shared with others as a team or giving the credit to most deserving and be happy for them. This will free one from self doubt and enable them to carry on*

- Keep trying
- Ask for help
- Keep reminders around of where you started from

> When we're growing, we're more productive. When we're productive, I feel better.

<sup>Beside the inspiring quotes mentioned above, I also want to remind myself to work hard and pour everything I have into this program so that I may be able to move back and land a job in Japan. This is a picture of me and my younger brother visiting me back when I was stationed in U.S. Naval Base Yokosuka. Really loved it there and now since I am home, I really need to work really hard to get where I want as a civilian.
