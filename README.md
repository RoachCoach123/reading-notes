## My Intrepetation of Growth Mindset

*It is when one realized that they are not the center of attention and also a center attention. One also has to realized in order to grow, they have to open up to new ideas but also open for debate for clarification. When an idea is being recognised as an accomplishment, it is better to be shared with others as a team or giving the credit to most deserving and be happy for them. Thus they are not center of attention but being recognized for their accomplishment indirectly as contributors or shared as a team. This would free the one from self doubt and be enable them to carry on with a growth mindset*

- Keep trying
- Ask for help
- Keep reminders around of where you started from
